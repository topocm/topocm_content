    "In the very beginning of the course, we told you that conservation laws - unitary symmetries of the Hamiltonian - do not lead to striking consequences on topology. They allow to reduce the problem by making the Hamiltonian block-diagonal, but not much else (see also Shinsei Ryu's introductory video to week eight).\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, it may seem that crystalline symmetries: mirror or reflection symmetries, rotation symmetries, and so on - are no exception to the above consideration. They are unitary symmetries whose operators commute with the Hamiltonian. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the role of crystalline symmetries can be quite subtle and it can have important consequences. The reason is that crystalline symmetries are non-local. They relate one point in a crystal to another point, possibly a very distant point. This means that in terms of the Bloch Hamiltonian of the crystal, these symmetries mix different values of momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider for instance a 2D crystal with a reflection symmetry $\\mathcal{R}: (x, y) \\to (-x, y)$ around the $x=0$ axis. In momentum space, this symmetry will read $RH(k_x, k_y)R^\\dagger = H(-k_x, k_y)$, with a certain unitary operator $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this type of constraint on the Brillouin zone, crystalline symmetries can have important consequences on the topological properties of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note however, that sometimes the mere presence of a surface can break a crystalline symmetry of the bulk, so that one should be careful when applying the bulk-boundary correspondence to properties based on crystalline symmetries."

We can split our Hamiltonian into the corresponding two sector $H_{\\pm}$ acting on the $C_2=\\pm i$ sectors respectively. Each of the Hamiltonians $H_{\\pm}$ are 2 dimensional Hamiltonians in class A (i.e. with no symmetry) and therefore we can associate a Chern number $N_{\\pm}$ with each of them. \n",
