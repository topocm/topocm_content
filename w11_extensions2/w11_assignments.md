# Topics for self-study

## Simulation: powers combined

Are you tired yet of all the different kinds of topology? If no, this assignment is for you :-)

By now you should have a feel for how to make new topological phases. Your task now is to combine the two systems you've learned about and to create a Floquet crystalline topological insulator. If you want even more challenge, create also a gapless Floquet topological material.

Take care however: if you take a topologically nontrivial system and just apply rapid driving, you'll still get a topological one. This cheating way is prohibited: at any moment during the driving cycle the Hamiltonian of your system should remain gapped.
