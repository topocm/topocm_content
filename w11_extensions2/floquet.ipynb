    "We see something very different from our expectations. All the bulk states are indeed at $E=0$, but there are two branches of dispersion that are clearly propagating. These can only belong to the edges, and since the two edges look identical, these two modes have to belong to the opposite edges. We seem to conclude that even though the bulk Hamiltonian is trivial, the edges carry chiral edge states, as if there was a finite Chern number.\n",

    "The two examples we've studied reveal an imporant feature of topological Floquet insulators. It seems that knowing the bulk Floquet Hamiltonian is sufficient to calculate the topological invariant, by just applying the known expression to the Floquet Hamiltonian. However, that's not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In rough terms, the reason for this insufficiency is due to Floquet topological insulators missing a topologically trivial state which can be taken as a reference. With any regular 2D Hamiltonian, we know that if we take $E \\rightarrow -\\infty$, we will get a trivial system with the Chern number zero. In a Floquet system, the only thing that lowering the energy tells us is that the Chern number is periodic in quasienergy, like any other observable property.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we need to know to derive the full topological invariant from the bulk properties? The answer is that we need the complete evolution operator for all moments in time, or in other words the full dependence $H(t)$. The actual calculation of the topological invariant is technically involved, and falls beyond what we can cover in this course. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the full classification of Floquet topological insulators is not yet accomplished."
