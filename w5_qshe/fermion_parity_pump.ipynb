Because of inversion symmetry, there is necessarily an identical pair at $-\\bar{k}_y$. So we get a total of 4 degenerate domain wall states from this type of gap closing - an even number of pairs.

To change the value of the topological invariant, we would need an odd number of pairs crossing zero energy.\n",
