Luckily, in the presence of [inversion symmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_%28physics%29#Effect_of_spatial_inversion_on_some_variables_of_classical_physics) - which reverses the lattice coordinates with respect to a symmetry center - the topological condition can be stated in rather simple terms.\n",

    "So let's consider a two-dimensional Bloch Hamiltonian $H(\\mathbf{k})$ with both inversion and time-reversal symmetry. Inversion symmetry has a unitary operator $\\mathcal{P}$ which maps $\\mathbf{k}\\rightarrow -\\mathbf{k}$ and satisfies $\\mathcal{P}^2=1$. If we have both inversion symmetry $\\mathcal{P}$ and time-reversal $\\mathcal{T}$, we get an anti-unitary symmetry $\\mathcal{T}\\otimes\\mathcal{P}$, which preserves $\\mathbf{k}$ and squares to $-1$. \n",

We conclude that every eigenstate at any $\\mathbf{k}$ is two-fold degenerate.  We may label these two eigenstates with an index $\\sigma=\\pm$. If spin is a good quantum number, $\\sigma$ labels two states with opposite spin. However, this may not be the case so we will just refer to it as a pseudospin associated with Kramers degeneracy.\n",
