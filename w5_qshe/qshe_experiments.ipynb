At some value of the magnetic field, they must cross. Furthemore, they will both cross the Fermi level if it is in the middle of the zero-field band gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to this fact, one observes a Hall effect in a certain range of fields, even when the Fermi level is placed in the middle of the zero-field band gap. And indeed, by comparing the experimental results with the expected behavior of the Landau levels, you see that the positions of the Fermi-level crossings coincide with the re-entrant Hall plateaus of the experimental traces - as marked by the green and red arrows.\n",
