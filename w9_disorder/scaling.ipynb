    "Based on the arguments we made in previous weeks, you could convince yourselves that certain properties, such as the bulk boundary correspondence, are robust as long as disorder isn't enough to close the gap. However, many topological properties that we measure could in principle be susceptible to disorder.\n",

Remember however that we made no such claims about the surface states of a three-dimensional topological insulator! In fact, while in three dimensions the conductance is certainly susceptible to disorder, topology forbids it from becoming zero. Such subtle properties require a more detailed understanding of disorder."

    "When we speak of disorder in electronic systems, the main distinction we need to keep in mind is that between extended and localized states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by thinking of a three dimensional metal with a low density of impurities, and hence weak disorder. In this limit, electrons moving through the system are only scattered by impurities every now and then, but otherwise they move ballistically between collisions. This picture is known as the [Drude model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drude_model), and yields a conductivity given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma=n e^2\\tau/m,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the electron density, $m$ is the electron mass and $\\tau$ the mean free time between collisions. In this limit, the electron wave functions are extended throughout the bulk of the system, much like the plane waves of a clean crystal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other extreme is the strong disorder limit, in which there is a strongly fluctuating random potential in the material, for instance due to a high density of impurities. This potential has minima at random positions in the material, where electrons can become trapped. The corresponding wave functions are localized exponentially close to the minima. If the density of impurities is high in the material, all electronic states are of this type. In this situation, the only mechanism for conduction in the material is tunneling between different potential minima. However, the minima may be far apart from each other, which leads to a suppression of conductance and to an insulating state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's discuss qualitatively the simplest effect of strong disorder on topological states, which are gapped. If we imagine a disorder potential with a Gaussian distribution, there are always \"rare regions\" where the disorder potential is very deep. Such potentials may thus yield energy levels in the middle of the gap. If disorder is strong, there might even be no energy gap at all! However, the electrons trapped in these rare regions are localized, and do not participate in any of the transport properties of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Thus, even weak disorder can close the energy gap, which is what protects topology, as discussed so far. However, since these localized states are isolated from each other, and most importantly from the edges, they do not affect any of the topological properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The considerations above make it clear that the presence or absence of an energy gap is not a good criterion to tell whether a system is insulating or not in the presence of strong disorder, and that we need to understand the nature of the electronic states in the system. Our definition of an insulating state must obey a new criterion. As will see next, this criterion can be obtained by studying conductance as a function of the system size."

We can only do this in the two aforementioned extreme limits, and actually only in certain dimensions. In principle, to see how the \"transition\" from extended to localized electrons happens as disorder is increased, one must solve the full quantum mechanical problem. So far, it seems impossible to solve this problem exactly in any dimension other than 1D, so we won't bother and instead discuss an educated guess, which gives us most of the answer."

    "To start with, let us be more specific and consider the conductance $G(L)$ of a $d$-dimensional block with sides $L$. The conductance represents the ease with which electrons can propagate through the block, and is has the natural unit $G_0=e^2/h$. Therefore, we can think of the dimensionless conductance $g(L)=G(L)/G_0$ as sort of a higher dimensional analog of the average transmission of electrons between the ends of the system, multiplied by the number of channels. If we take the analogy with transmission seriously, we can guess that the conductance of a combination of blocks, each with conductance $g(L)$, has conductance $g'$ which depends on $g(L)$. This is not very different from what we expect classically. For example, consider a connected pair of metallic blocks of conductivity $g(L)$ each, such that the total conductivity of the connected blocks is $g'$. If the blocks are connected in series, then $g'=g(L)/2$. If they are connected in parallel, then $g'=2 g(L)$. "
