    "If this is the case, $\\alpha$ is the sum of an order $\\sim L/\\xi$ of uncorrelated values of $m$. By using the [central limit theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), we can say that $\\alpha$ is a normally distributed variable with zero mean and a variance growing linearly in $L$. Since $\\alpha$ is a random variable, so is the transmission probability $T=|t^2|=\\cosh^{-2}(\\alpha)$. From the probability distribution of $\\alpha$, we can obtain the scaling behavior of $T$ as\n",
