    "So far we've seen two examples of Dirac points in two dimensions, the surface of a 3D topological insulator and graphene. You might wonder, why don't we have such cones in three dimensions? These do indeed exist and are called Weyl points instead of Dirac points. The reason is historical - Dirac's equation for the electron (which  is in 3D) involves states with four components, two for the electron and two for the hole. The direct generalization of graphene to $3D$ that we will discuss involves states with two electron component. Such electron states with linear dispersion were studied first by Weyl, and have strange properties as we will illustrate below.\n",
