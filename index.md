# Online course on topology in condensed matter

This is a [open](license.md) online course on topology in condensed matter.
Initially developed for the edX platform in 2015, its development continues here.

After following this course you will:

- Discover how topological concepts manifest in condensed matter systems
- Get an overview of different research directions and important developments
- Learn to combine the relevant math with simulations and physical arguments to improve your understanding

Go right to the [introduction](w0_background/intro) for in-depth information about the course.
