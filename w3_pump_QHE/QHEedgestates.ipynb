After all, couldn't we just build a theory of a single chiral edge state, neglecting the the bulk of the quantum Hall system and the existence of the other edge? Can't a truly one-dimensional system just show the same behavior of the chiral edge state of the quantum Hall effect?\n",

The number of electrons at one edge can increase, because it is being depleted from the other edge (which is not included in our “theory”) and pumped through the bulk until it appears.\n",

The chiral anomaly tells us that we cannot have a consistent theory for a chiral edge state without a bulk, which at the same time conserves electric charge. Chiral edge states or anything else that exhibits a chiral anomaly are an example of the bulk edge correspondence, since they can only appear at the edge of a two dimensional system and never in isolation.\n",
