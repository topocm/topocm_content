    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![](figures/hall_bar.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron gas is contacted by six electrodes, numbered in the figure. We can use this Hall bar geometry set-up to measure the transport characteristics of the gas, as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transport characteristics are tabulated using the 4 components $\\sigma_{xx},\\sigma_{yy},\\sigma_{xy}$ and $\\sigma_{yx}$ of the so-called conductivity tensor. Once we know the conductivity tensor, we can use it to calculate how the current density $\\mathbf{j} = (j_x,j_y)$ flows in response to the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = (E_x,E_y)$ in the metal, through the equation  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$j_\\alpha=\\sum_\\beta \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}E_{\\beta}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By inverting this set of relations between current densities and electric field, we obtain the resistivities $\\rho_{xx}, \\rho_{xy}, \\dots$, which are more often reported in experimental data. Also, in two-dimensional systems there is no real difference between conductance and conductivity (or resistance and resistivity) - they have the same physical units. So the terms are somehow interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to use the Hall bar device is to drive a current $I$ along the $x$ direction, so that there is a current density $j_x=(I/W)$ where $W$ is the width of the sample. There is no current density in the perpendicular direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the electric field using the Hall bar geometry from the voltage drops between the probes with voltages $V_{1,2,3,4}$.\n",
    "We can then measure the $x$-component of the electric field from the longitudinal voltage drop $V_L\\sim (V_1-V_2)$ or  $(V_3-V_4)$ according to the averaged equation "

    "$$E_y \\equiv \\frac{V_1+V_2-V_4-V_3}{2W}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hall bar can only measure the conductance completely for isotropic or rotationally invariant systems. If we rotate the system by 90 degrees we can transform $x\\rightarrow y$ and $y\\rightarrow -x$. So we expect $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=\\sigma_L$, the longitudinal conductance. If we apply this same rotation transformation we conclude that $\\sigma_{xy}=-\\sigma_{yx}=\\sigma_H$, the *Hall conductance*. \n",
    "\n",

An electron performing a cyclotron orbit at velocity $v$ has angular momentum $L=mvr_c=eB r^2_c$.
