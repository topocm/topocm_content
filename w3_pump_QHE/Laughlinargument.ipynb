    "How does one get a Hall effect? The key is to break time-reversal symmetry. This is because a flowing current breaks time-reversal symmetry, while an electric field doesn't. So obviously any system with a Hall effect must break time-reversal symmetry. \n",

A Hall current is special in that it is **dissipationless**. We can drive a Hall current without wasting any energy because the current flows perpendicular to the voltage gradient.\n",

    "## How to measure the Hall effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a two dimensional gas of electrons immersed in a strong magnetic field. In particular, we take the following geometry, which is called a Hall bar and is routinely used in experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](figures/hall_bar.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron gas is contacted by six electrodes, numbered in the figure. We can use this Hall bar geometry set-up to measure the transport characteristics of the gas, as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transport characteristics are tabulated using the 4 components $\\sigma_{xx},\\sigma_{yy},\\sigma_{xy}$ and $\\sigma_{yx}$ of the so-called conductivity tensor. Once we know the conductivity tensor, we can use it to calculate how the current density $\\mathbf{j} = (j_x,j_y)$ flows in response to the electric field $\\mathbf{E} = (E_x,E_y)$ in the metal, through the equation  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$j_\\alpha=\\sum_\\beta \\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}E_{\\beta}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By inverting this set of relations between current densities and electric field, you can obtain the resistivities $\\rho_{xx}, \\rho_{xy}, \\dots$, which are more often reported in experimental data. Also, in two-dimensional systems there is no real difference between conductance and conductivity (or resistance and resistivity) - they have the same physical units. So the terms are somehow interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way to use the Hall bar device is to drive a current $I$ along the $x$ direction, so that there is a current density $j_x=(I/W)$ where $W$ is the width of the sample. There is no current density in the perpendicular direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can measure the electric field using the Hall bar geometry from the voltage drops between the probes with voltages $V_{1,2,3,4}$.\n",
    "We can then measure the $x$-component of the electric field from the longitudinal voltage drop $V_L\\sim (V_1-V_2)$ or  $(V_3-V_4)$ according to the averaged equation "

    "$$E_x \\equiv \\frac{V_1+V_3-V_2-V_4}{2L}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can measure the $y$-component of the electric field from the  Hall voltage $V_H=(V_1-V_3)$ or $(V_2-V_4)$. Specifically we can calculate the electric field as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_y \\equiv \\frac{V_1+V_2-V_4-V_3}{2L}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hall bar can only measure the conductance completely for isotropic or rotationally invariant systems. Clearly, if we rotate the system by 90 degrees we can transform $x\\rightarrow y$ and $y\\rightarrow -x$. So we expect $\\sigma_{xx}=\\sigma_{yy}=\\sigma_L$, which is referred to as the longitudinal conductance. If we apply this same rotation transformation we conclude that $\\sigma_{xy}=-\\sigma_{y x}=\\sigma_H$, which is referred to as the Hall conductance. \n",
    "\n",
    "So with rotational invariance the 4 component conductance tensor has only 2 independent components i.e. the longitudinal and Hall conductance. We can expect to measure these using the two electric fields $E_{x,y}$ that we measure using the Hall bar. \n",
    "For such a system we can solve the simultaneous set of equations  $j_y=\\sigma_L E_y - \\sigma_H E_x=0$ and $j_x=\\sigma_L E_x+\\sigma_H E_y$ to obtain $\\sigma_{L,H}$. Solving these equations we get \n",

    "As you already heard from Ady Stern in the intro video, people have measured the Hall conductance of this exact system to incredible precision. At relatively high density, the Hall conductance of this system does behave itself and scales linearly with the gate voltage, which is tuned to control the density. At low filling factors, one would expect many non-idealities like disorder and interaction to break the Galilean invariance based argument and lead to a Hall conductance $\\sigma_H$ that varies from sample to sample and disorder.
