Since they are one-dimensional, these states will necessarily be spatially on top of each other, essentially a pair of propagating modes with opposite velocity.

Such a system has a parabolic dispersion and the low energy excitations at a finite Fermi wave-vector $k=\\pm k_F$ move in opposite directions. The catch is that these two states have different momenta, and it is tricky (though not impossible) to deal with momentum conservation when pairing the edges. So we will avoid this approach.\n",

This flexibility in interpreting the Hamiltonian terms in different ways, depending on the context, is part of the advantage of thinking in terms of toy models.\n",
