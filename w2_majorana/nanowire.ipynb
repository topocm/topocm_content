    "An important remark: You might now think that since spin-orbit depends on spin, spin-orbit we would make the magnetic field unnecessary. This is not true: Since spin-orbit preserves time-reversal symmetry, in the absence of a magnetic field the energy spectrum of the model would have a *Kramers degeneracy*, as you learned last week. To get one unpaired Majorana mode per edge and not two, we need to break Kramers degeneracy and therefore break time-reversal symmetry. So the combination of both Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling is needed."
