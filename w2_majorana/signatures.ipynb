    "First of all, the determinant of a unitary matrix such as $r_0$ is always a complex number with unit norm, so $\\left|\\det\\,r_0\\,\\right|=1$. Second, because of particle-hole symmetry, the determinant is real: $\\det r_0 = \\det\\, (\\tau_x r^*_0\\,\\tau_x) = \\det\\,r_0^*\\,=(\\det\\,r_0)^*$. Hence, $\\det\\,r_0\\,= \\pm 1$.

    "The only way to make the determinant change sign is to close the bulk gap in the superconducting electrode. If the gap goes to zero, then it is not true that an incoming electron coming from the normal metal can only be normal-reflected or Andreev-reflected. It can also just enter the superconducting electrode as an electron. Hence the reflection matrix no longer contains all the possible processes taking place at the interface, and it won't be unitary anymore. This allows the determinant to change sign.

There are only two possibilities for both conditions to be true: either $|r_{ee}|=1$ (**perfect  normal reflection**) or $|r_{eh}|=1$ (**perfect Andreev reflection**). The situation cannot change without a phase transition. Thus the quantized conductance of the Majorana mode is topologically robust in this case, and in fact survives past the tunneling limit. "
