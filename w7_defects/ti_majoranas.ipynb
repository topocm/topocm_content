This is the essence of bulk-edge correspondence. For example, the unpaired Majorana bound states at the edges of a Kitaev chain exist because they are separated by the bulk of the chain.\n",

    "Observe that the systems we have studied so far all had something in common: the topologically protected edge states were separated by a bulk that is one dimension higher than the dimension of the edge states.

    "In the past weeks, we have studied two systems that appear very different, but where topology showed up in a very similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's consider the quantum spin-Hall insulator. As we saw two weeks ago, it is characterized by a fermion parity pump: if you take a Corbino disk made out of a quantum spin-Hall insulator and change the flux by half a normal flux quantum, that is by $h/2e$, one unit of fermion parity is transferred from one edge of the sample to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, let us consider a one-dimensional topological superconductor, like we studied in weeks two and three. If such a system is closed into a Josephson ring, and the flux through the ring is advanced by one superconducting flux quantum $h/2e$, the fermion parity at the Josephson junction connecting the two ends changes from even to odd, or viceversa. This is the $4Ï€$ Josephson effect, one of the main signatures of topological superconductivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the change in flux is equal to $h/2e$ in both cases, since a superconducting flux quantum $h/2e$ is half of the normal flux quantum $h/e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggest that once you have a quantum-spin Hall insulator, you are only one small step away from topological superconductivity and Majoranas. The only ingredient that is missing is to introduce superconducting pairing on the quantum spin-Hall edge.\n",
    "\n",

    "The superconductor covers the entire quantum spin-Hall edge except for a small segment, which acts as a Josephson junction with a phase difference given by $\\phi = 2e\\Phi/\\hbar$, where $\\Phi$ is the magnetic flux through the center of the disk. We imagine that the superconductor gaps out the helical edge by proximity, which means that Cooper pairs can tunnel in and out from the superconductor into the edge. In order for this to happen, a conventional $s$-wave superconductor is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not repeat our pumping experiment, that is increasing the flux $\\Phi$ by $h/2e$. We know that one unit of fermion parity must be transferred from the inner edge of the disk to the outer edge. However, the only place where we can now find a zero-energy state is the Josephson junction, because the rest of the edge is gapped.\n",

The magnet flips the spin of an incoming electron, or hole, while the superconductor turns an incoming electron with spin up into an outgoing hole with spin down. These two different types of reflection processes combine together to form a Majorana bound state.\n",
