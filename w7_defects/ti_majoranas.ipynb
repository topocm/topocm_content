As we saw two weeks ago, it is characterized by a fermion parity pump: if you take a Corbino disk made out of a quantum spin-Hall insulator and change the flux by half a normal flux quantum, that is by $h/2e$, one unit of fermion parity is transferred from one edge of the sample to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, let us consider a one-dimensional topological superconductor, like we studied in weeks two and three. If such a system is closed into a Josephson ring, and the flux through the ring is advanced by one superconducting flux quantum $h/2e$, the fermion parity at the Josephson junction connecting the two ends changes from even to odd, or viceversa. This is the $4π$ Josephson effect, one of the main signatures of topological superconductivity.\n",

We imagine that the superconductor gaps out the helical edge by proximity, which means that Cooper pairs can tunnel in and out from the superconductor into the edge. In order for this to happen, a conventional $s$-wave superconductor is enough.\n",
