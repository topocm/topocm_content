    "Let's think a bit more about these crossings. At first, they might look a bit mysterious. In general a crossing between energy levels happens in the presence of a conserved quantity, and our random Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian does not seem to have an obvious one. Let's however recall what we said earlier: While the mean-field Hamiltonian of a superconductor does not conserve the number of particles, it conserves the parity of this number. In other words, forming and breaking Cooper pairs does not affect whether the superconducting quantum dots contains an even or odd number of electrons. In short, fermion parity is a conserved quantity (provided that isolated electrons do not enter or leave the dot, a possibility which we will disregard).\n",
    "\n",
    "The above observation reveals that the existence of crossings is due to the fermion parity conservation. Fermion parity, however, is a many-body quantity, which cannot be directly described in terms of the single particle picture of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian. \n",
    "To understand the existence of the crossings, recall that to obtain a Bogoliubov-de Gennes description of the superconductor we had to double the number of degrees of freedom by introducing holes.\n",
    "Hence, unlike in the case of sublattice symmetry, a pair of $\\pm E$ energy levels does not corresponds to two distinct quantum states, but to a *single* quantum state.\n",
    "This quantum state is a coherent superposition of electrons and holes - a *Bogoliubov quasiparticle*: it has an excitation energy $E$, and it is created by an operator $a^\\dagger = u c^\\dagger + v c$.\n",
    "Populating the partner state at energy $-E$ is the same as emptying the positive energy state.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a pair of levels crosses zero energy, the excitation energy $E$ of the Bogoliubov quasiparticle changes sign and it becomes favorable to add a Bogoliubov quasiparticle to, or remove it from the superconducting quantum dot. In other words, at each crossing the fermion parity in the ground state of the dot changes from even to odd, or vice versa. Hence these crossings are *fermion parity switches*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the ground state fermion parity is preserved by the superconducting Hamiltonian if there are no Bogoliubov quasiparticles crossing zero energy, the ground state fermion parity is the topological invariant of this system. It is clear however that this invariant is of a different nature than the one of the non-superconducting systems, which is given by the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian. The latter cannot change for a Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian, which has a symmetric energy spectrum, and hence it is not suitable to describe changes in fermion parity. Is there a way to compute this new invariant directly from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian?"
