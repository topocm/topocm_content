# What's new

Welcome to the changelog for *Topology in condensed matter: tying quantum knots*. This page highlights the most relevant updates to the course material and infrastructure. Bookmark it to keep track of fresh content each teaching block.

## November 2025

I (Anton Akhmerov) found some time to upgrade the course materials to use:

- The recently released [Jupyter Book 2.0](https://jupyterbook.org/stable/) (huge shoutout to the Jupyter Book team!)
- Plotly for interactive figures, instead of Holoviews, which served use well for many years, but became difficult to customize.

I did not yet change the course content itself, but I plan to do so—there are many exciting developments in topological condensed matter physics since the course was created. Stay tuned!

I also plan to add a discussion forum to allow the course users to interact with each other and with the authors. Keep in touch ;)
